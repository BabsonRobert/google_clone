The Odin Project HTML / CSS project.  Building a mockup of Google.com.



Couple of important take-aways: 
  1. The polish on the styling is the difference between a boring flat document, and a vibrant, interactive website. Little touches like borders on the buttons when hovering, or the shadow behind the search bar lend a feeling of completeness to the page.  

  2. Keeping the style.css sheet clean might keep you from wasting 20 minutes trying to figure out why the changes you are trying to make are not showing up. (hint: make sure the CSS selector is actually targetting something...)
